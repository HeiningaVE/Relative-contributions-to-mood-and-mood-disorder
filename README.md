# Abstract #
Risk and protective lifestyle factors have been almost exclusively investigated in isolation, leaving their *combined and relative impact* on mood and mental health largely unknown. Identifying such impact can inform prevention and treatment strategies, and can help to uncover underlying mechanisms. 

Building upon the risk and protective factors from daily life identified by Pemberton & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz (2016), Fuller-Tyszkiewicz and colleagues (2017) investigated the collective and relative contributions of the five most robust unidirectional lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep quality, appraisal of social company, negative event, coping, and physical activity) to subsequent changes in *Negative Affect*. 

In the present study, using a larger sample and a fixed Experience Sampling Method (ESM) study design of 3 time points a day for 30 consecutive days, we replicate part of the analyses of Fuller-Tyszkiewicz and colleagues (2017) with regard to Negative Affect and extend their finding with a first description of the within-person combined and relative contributions of the five risk/protective factors for *Positive Affect* in daily life.
